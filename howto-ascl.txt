Workflow to add an ASCL index to the ADASS proceedings
======================================================

Version 2015  (Peter Teuben)

1) in asp2010.sty change the "Object Index" to "ASCL Index" in 4 locations:

% diff asp2010.sty asp2010.sty~
926c926
<   \newindex{obj}{odx}{ond}{\Large ASCL Index}
---
>   \newindex{obj}{odx}{ond}{\Large Object Index}
958,959c958,959
<   \markboth{ASCL Index}{ASCL Index}
<   \tocentry{\itshape ASCL Index}{}
---
>   \markboth{Object Index}{Object Index}
>   \tocentry{\itshape Object Index}{}


2) in aspvolume.tex  activate the printobjectindex

% diff aspvolume.tex aspvolume.tex~
706c706
< \printobjectindex   % Print the Object Index by uncommenting this command
---
> %\printobjectindex   % Print the Object Index by uncommenting this command

3) create a lookup list of ascl index vs. code names, in some file, ascl2.txt
it looks as follows (and is generated with a script from the website)

ascl:1109.007 SuperBayeS
# 1109.008 Multipole Vectors
ascl:1109.009 CMBquick


Note the dubious ones are editing by hand or by code. So manual inspection on 
this list is needed after is was generated from the ascl toolkit we keep on
github.


4) run the ascl.py command, which will spit out the lines where codes might be
mentioned:

% ascl.py  Antognini_Jonathan_O7-2.tex
...
#   Using MongoDB and Astropy Python library, we implemented a Conesearch service 
\ooindex{Astropy, ascl:1304.002} 
...

now you can enter your favorite editor, look for this line and cut and paste the
ooindex line where appropriate.  This could be automated, but it turns out most
code names are also english names, so there are too many false positives. It is
more efficient to look at this output, enter the editor and cut and paste the ones
that appear right.



5) the following Makefile target should create a pdf with an author and ASCL index.
(bibtex stuff that was done before should not change, and is left out of this)

F = aspvolume
all:
	pdflatex $(F)
	pdflatex $(F)
	makeindex < $(F).adx > $(F).and	
	makeindex < $(F).odx > $(F).ond
	pdflatex $(F)
	pdflatex $(F)
