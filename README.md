==========

Some tools to work with ASCL (Astrophysics Source Code Library).


See http://ascl.net for the repository.

   * **ascl**           shell script to grep through a locally cashed database
   * **ascl.py**        helper script for ADASS proceedings
   * **check_code.py**  check txt files (e.g. arXiv PDF's) for magic words (description vector)
   * **make_ascl2**     shell script to scrape the ascl website to help create ascl2.txt
   * **ascl2.txt**      just a sample, but we'll try and keep this up to date
